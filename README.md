### Hello I'm Chris
  #### *An Information Systems Student*
  
  
 # **About Me** 
<p> I Currently am a Senior at East Tennessee State University finishing my Bachelor's of Science in Computing. I am entering into the Information Systems 
    space. If I had a favorite hobby I would say it would be traveling and engaging with different cultures, I have been to a couple different countries.
    I aspire to be able to work with people on a global scale. Either directly by travel for business or through remote means.
    I would like to have a career where I can work on or manage a project, but have the freedomto be where I want to be in the world.

 # **What I'M Learning / Working on**
  <p> At the Moment I am learning Git and How GitHub works, :wave: hi i'm new here. Over the last couple years I have learned Java, Python, HTML, CSS, and, SQL.
      I am the most experienced with Java but have learned some Python on the side. I will soon be starting to learn C#, I expect that to become my main programming lamguage.
      I don't have a lot of experience coding or making projects, But what I have done with classmates in college has really got me on a good start. I am currently working 
      on a old Java project atm that was started in college a couple years ago, It is a Random Monster Generator that creates a number of enemies for use in a Dungeons and
      Dragons encounter during gameplay. It makes coming up with enemies complete with random stats easy. I will be posting projects here in the future as a coding portfolio,
      so keep a lookout and follow me! 
  </p>
